# buildDemo
I've combinied a very simple example of building Bootstrap sass with bower and gulp. Notice namespaced bootstrap by importing our sass files into our main.scss before compiling to main.css

### This is the bootstrap < v4 version
bootstrap 4: [Build Demo](https://github.com/zerosquadron/buildDemo/tree/Bootstrap4) 

### To install:
`$ git clone https://github.com/zerosquadron/buildDemo.git`

`$ npm install`

`$ gulp`

## Bootstrap
[bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/)

## Gulp
[gulp](http://gulpjs.com)

## Bower
[bower](http://bower.io)
