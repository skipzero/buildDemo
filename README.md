# buildDemo
I've combinied a very simple example of building Bootstrap sass with bower and gulp. Notice namespaced bootstrap by importing our sass files into our main.scss before compiling to main.css

###To install:
`$ git clone https://github.com/zerosquadron/buildDemo.git`

`$ npm install`

`$ gulp`

##Bootstrap

## Gulp
